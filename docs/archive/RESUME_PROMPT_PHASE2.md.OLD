# Resume Prompt for Phase 2 Testing

**Copy this entire prompt when resuming after compaction**

---

## Context

You are continuing work on the **Kosmos AI Scientist** E2E testing project. Phase 1 sanity testing is **COMPLETE** with all core components validated. You are now ready to begin **Phase 2: Paper-Driven Deep Testing** to validate the autonomous research vision from the Kosmos paper.

---

## Phase 1 Summary (COMPLETE ✅)

**Final Results:** 5 passed, 7 skipped (33.04s, ~$0.01 spent)

**Validated Components:**
1. ✅ **LLM Provider Integration** - DeepSeek API working via OpenAI-compatible interface
2. ✅ **HypothesisGeneratorAgent** - Generates domain-specific hypotheses with testability scores
3. ✅ **CodeValidator** - AST-based safety validation working
4. ✅ **CodeExecutor** - Direct execution mode functional
5. ✅ **End-to-End Mini Workflow** - Question → Hypothesis → Analysis → Results pipeline validated

**Test File:** `tests/e2e/test_system_sanity.py` (12 tests total)

**Deferred Components (all justified, won't block Phase 2):**
- ⏭️ ExperimentDesigner - PromptTemplate.format() framework issue
- ⏭️ CodeGenerator - Requires ExperimentProtocol object (complex setup)
- ⏭️ Sandboxed Execution - Docker API investigation needed
- ⏭️ Statistical Analysis - Module API needs investigation
- ⏭️ DataAnalyst - Agent API needs investigation
- ⏭️ Database Persistence - Hypothesis model missing autoincrement=True
- ⏭️ Knowledge Graph - Neo4j authentication not configured

**Key Finding:** System designed for graceful degradation - ResearchDirectorAgent handles missing components and continues workflow.

---

## Critical API Patterns Discovered

**All agents return Pydantic response objects, not primitives:**

```python
# LLM responses
response = client.generate(...)
assert response.content  # NOT: len(response) or assert response

# Hypothesis generation
response = generator.generate_hypotheses(...)
assert len(response.hypotheses)  # NOT: len(response)

# Safety validation
report = validator.validate(...)
assert report.passed  # NOT: .is_safe
assert len(report.violations)  # NOT: .has_dangerous_operations

# Code execution
exec_result = executor.execute(...)
assert exec_result.success  # boolean
assert exec_result.stdout  # string
assert exec_result.execution_time  # float
```

## Phase 2 Goals

Validate the **Kosmos AI Scientist autonomous research vision**:

1. **Full Autonomous Research Loop** - Test all workflow phases that are implemented
2. **Multi-Domain Capability** - Test across 5 research domains (biology, neuroscience, physics, chemistry, materials)
3. **Multi-Iteration Refinement** - Test hypothesis evolution over 3-5 cycles
4. **Workflow State Progression** - Verify ResearchDirectorAgent orchestrates correctly
5. **Hypothesis Pool Growth** - Verify hypotheses accumulate over iterations
6. **Performance Validation** - Measure actual performance (optional)

---

## Phase 2 Priority Tasks

### PRIORITY 1: Multi-Domain Testing (HIGH)

**Status:** Neuroscience and Biology tests already passing

**Already Working:**
- `tests/e2e/test_full_research_workflow.py::TestBiologyResearchWorkflow::test_full_biology_workflow` - PASSING
- `tests/e2e/test_full_research_workflow.py::TestNeuroscienceResearchWorkflow::test_full_neuroscience_workflow` - PASSING

**Both tests validate:**
- Research question → hypothesis generation
- Workflow state progression
- Hypothesis details from database
- ResearchDirectorAgent orchestration

**Next Steps:**
1. Re-run biology and neuroscience tests to confirm still passing (~$0.30)
2. Create physics domain test (copy neuroscience pattern) (~$0.15)
3. Create chemistry domain test (~$0.15)
4. Create materials domain test (~$0.15)

**Total Budget:** ~$0.75

---

### PRIORITY 2: Multi-Iteration Testing (HIGH)

**Status:** Test implemented but needs debugging

**File:** `tests/e2e/test_full_research_workflow.py::TestPaperValidation::test_multi_iteration_research_cycle`

**What it tests:**
- 3 complete research iterations
- Workflow state progression through phases
- Results accumulation
- Convergence detection

**Known Issue:** May get stuck in same workflow state (has safety limits built in)

**Next Steps:**
1. Run test and observe behavior (~$0.30)
2. Debug workflow state transitions if needed
3. Verify hypothesis pool grows across iterations
4. Validate results are stored

**Total Budget:** ~$0.30-0.50

---

### PRIORITY 3: Workflow State Validation (MEDIUM)

**Status:** Partially validated in existing tests

**What's Validated:**
- Workflow starts: `result["status"] == "research_started"`
- Workflow has state: `status["workflow_state"]` exists
- States include: initializing, generating_hypotheses, designing_experiments, executing, analyzing

**What Needs Testing:**
1. State progression logic (does workflow advance through states?)
2. Hypothesis pool growth (do hypotheses accumulate?)
3. Results storage (are results persisted?)

**Create New Tests:**
```python
# In tests/e2e/test_full_research_workflow.py

def test_workflow_phase_progression():
    """Test director progresses through workflow states."""
    # Track states visited over 10-20 steps
    # Verify workflow doesn't get stuck
    # Validate state transitions make sense

def test_hypothesis_pool_growth():
    """Test hypothesis pool grows with iterations."""
    # Start workflow
    # Execute several steps
    # Check len(director.research_plan.hypothesis_pool) > 0
```

**Total Budget:** ~$0.40-0.60

---

# - Verify safety limits prevent infinite loops
# - Debug state progression logic

# Budget: ~$0.30-0.50
```

**Day 4: Expand to New Domains**

## Known Issues and Workarounds

### Issue 1: Workflow May Get Stuck
**Symptom:** Workflow stays in same state indefinitely
**Workaround:** Tests have safety limits (max 20 steps, stuck detection after 3 identical states)
**Solution:** This is expected - some phases may not progress if components are missing (e.g., ExperimentDesigner)

### Issue 2: Some Components Skipped
**Symptom:** Workflow skips certain phases
**Expected:** Yes - ExperimentDesigner, DataAnalyst, etc. not fully functional
**Impact:** Workflow should still progress through hypothesis generation and execution
**Solution:** Accept graceful degradation, focus on what works

### Issue 3: Database Warnings
**Symptom:** SQLAlchemy warnings about autoincrement
**Workaround:** In-memory storage works, database persistence skipped in Phase 1
**Impact:** ResearchDirectorAgent continues with in-memory storage
**Solution:** Not critical for Phase 2, defer to production deployment

### Issue 4: Neo4j Not Configured
**Symptom:** "Neo4j authentication failed" warnings
**Expected:** Yes - Neo4j credentials not in .env
**Impact:** Knowledge graph persistence unavailable, system uses in-memory storage
**Solution:** Graceful degradation - not critical for Phase 2

## What to Ask When You Resume

**Suggested First Message:**

"I'm ready to begin Phase 2 testing. I've read:
- PHASE1_FINAL_RESULTS.md (5 components validated)
- PHASE2_FOUNDATION.md (testing strategy)
- INITIAL_E2E_PLAN.md (master plan)

Current status:
- Phase 1: COMPLETE (5 passed, 7 skipped, $0.01 spent)
- Budget: $19.99 remaining
- Working tests: biology and neuroscience workflows
- Next: Multi-domain testing and multi-iteration debugging

Should I start by re-running the neuroscience and biology tests to confirm they're still passing, then move to debugging the multi-iteration test?"

---

## Success Metrics for Phase 2

**Minimum Viable:**
- ✅ 3+ domains tested (biology, neuroscience, + 1 more)
- ✅ 1+ multi-iteration workflow completes
- ✅ Workflow state progression validated
- ✅ Hypothesis pool grows across iterations

**Stretch Goals:**
- All 5 domains tested
- 3+ iteration cycles complete
- Performance benchmarks measured

---

## Critical Reminders

1. **Budget Monitoring:** Check https://platform.deepseek.com/usage before major test runs
2. **Cost Efficiency:** DeepSeek is 28-35× cheaper than estimated - don't worry about small tests
3. **Graceful Degradation:** Missing components (ExperimentDesigner, DataAnalyst) won't break workflow
4. **Workflow Orchestration:** ResearchDirectorAgent is the key component - it's already working
5. **API Patterns:** All agents return Pydantic objects - access via attributes, not direct values
6. **Database Issues:** Not critical - system falls back to in-memory storage
7. **Commit Messages:** User requested removal of co-authored attributions - use clean commits only
